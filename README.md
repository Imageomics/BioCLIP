# BioCLIP

This is the repository for the BioCLIP model and the TreeOfLife-10M dataset.

BioCLIP is a CLIP model trained on new 10M-image dataset of biological organisms with fine-grained taxonomic labels.
BioCLIP outperforms general domain baselines on a wide spread of biology-related tasks, including zero-shot and few-shot classification.

We plan to release our code and data soon, but feel free to get started with the [model](https://huggingface.co/imageomics/bioclip) using [OpenCLIP](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip) or play with the [demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/imageomics/bioclip-demo).
