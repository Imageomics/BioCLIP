abstract: "Images of the natural world are an abundant source of biological
  information. There are many computational methods and tools, particularly
  computer vision, for extracting information from images. However, existing
  methods consist of bespoke models, not adaptable or extendable from their
  targeted task to new questions, contexts, and datasets. We thus develop the
  first large-scale multimodal model, BioCLIP, for general biology questions on
  images. We leverage the unique properties of biology (abundance and variety of
  images and availability of rich structured biological knowledge) as the the
  application domain for computer vision."
